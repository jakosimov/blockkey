<h1></h1>

Blockkey is a secure, decentralised platform for managing software license keys. It uses a proof-of-stake blockchain to provide consensus, immutability, and reliability.

### User-friendly

The Blockkey platform allows users around the globe to pay for software that they use. Unlike other platforms, Blockkey allows users to easily resell keys that they no longer need.

### Developer-friendly

By using the client-side library, developers can easily lock features of their application unless the user buys a license key. You won't have to worry about maintaining license servers, but you will be rewarded if you run a Blockkey node. Key reselling can also be controlled - a small fee will go to both the developer and the node operator!

### Resilient

Users do not have to worry about license servers going offline - as long as the blockkey network remains online*, all licenses will continue to function.

*In the event of a catastrophic failure, developers can manually verify license holders.
